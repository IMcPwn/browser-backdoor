BrowserBackdoor is an [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) application that uses a JavaScript WebSocket Backdoor to connect to the listener.

BrowserBackdoorServer is a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) server that listens for incoming WebSocket connections
and creates a command-line interface for sending commands to the remote system.

The JavaScript backdoor in BrowserBackdoor can be used on all browsers that support WebSockets.
It will not have access to the Electron API of the host computer unless the BrowserBackdoor Client application is used.

Some things you can do if you have access to the Electron API:

1. [Open new browser windows that can point to any website.]
(http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/shell/#shellopenexternalurl-options) (already built-in. See: [server/modules/openURL.js](https://github.com/IMcPwn/browser-backdoor/blob/master/server/modules/openURL.js)).

2. [Change and read the clipboard.]
(http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/clipboard/#clipboard) (already built-in. See: [server/modules/readClipboard.js](https://github.com/IMcPwn/browser-backdoor/blob/master/server/modules/readClipboard.js) and [server/modules/writeClipboard.js](https://github.com/IMcPwn/browser-backdoor/blob/master/server/modules/writeClipboard.js)).

3. [Access cross-platform Operating System notifications and the tray on OS X and Windows.]
(http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/tray/#tray)

4. [Take screenshots.]
(http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/desktop-capturer/#desktopcapturer) (already built-in. See: [server/modules/screenshot.js](https://github.com/IMcPwn/browser-backdoor/blob/master/server/modules/screenshot.js)).

5. [Execute arbitrary system commands.]
(http://stackoverflow.com/a/28394895) (already built-in. See: [server/modules/execCommand.js](https://github.com/IMcPwn/browser-backdoor/blob/master/server/modules/execCommand.js))

6. [Run at startup.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-launch) (already built-in. See: [client/main.js](https://github.com/IMcPwn/browser-backdoor/blob/master/client/main.js) and [server/modules/manageStartup.js](https://github.com/IMcPwn/browser-backdoor/blob/master/server/modules/manageStartup.js)).

Usage
===================
The client application will run in the background and provide no user interface while running. 
To check that it's running, quit it, or enable/disable system startup press Command (OS X) OR Control (Windows/Linux) + Alt + \ or whatever you configured the shortcut as in client/main.js.
